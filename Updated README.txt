Hey there, Thanks for the order. Truly Appriciate it. Now that you have this wonderful bot with you, you'll need to set it up. That's what this file is for.

Getting your bot token:
Head over to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new application. Now go over to the bot section, click create bot. Now you can customise your bot's name and image.
Scroll a bit down and enable Presence, server members and message intents. This is super important. After you're done with setup, click reset token and copy the new token.
You will need this later on

Bot setup:

If you already have python, you can skip Step 1 and 2
1. Go to https://www.python.org/ and download the latest python.
2. Run the installer and select "Add python to PATH" (VERY IMPORTANT)

3. Open command prompt and type in 'pip install -U py-cord --pre' and 'pip install PycordUtils'
4. Now you should go to bot folder, open up config.json and paste in the token you got earlier inside the "".
Now you can run the bot and enjoy its benefits. Do not forget to mark the order as complete and give us a good 5 star review. Cheers!
